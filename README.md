# Intracranial-herrmorhage-segementation
This project focuses on developing an efficient algorithm for the segmentation of intracranial hemorrhage, a condition involving bleeding within the brain. By accurately identifying and delineating hemorrhage regions from medical imaging data, help improve diagnosis and assist in prompt medical intervention, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.
